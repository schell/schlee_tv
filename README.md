### explainer

Your site is made up of a number of pages each of which are contained in the
[site](https://github.com/schell/schlee_tv/tree/master/site) folder. To edit
one of these pages, find the you are looking for, click on it to show the
preview, then click the "pencil" icon to edit the page.

Once you are editing you can use
[markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
to format your pages.

When you are done making changes, scroll down to the bottom and click the "commit"
button. This will automatically deploy your changes to your site. You can then
click the
["actions" tab at the top of the page to check the status of the deployment](https://github.com/schell/schlee_tv/actions).

Once the deployment has finished successfully you should be able to view your changes
on your site.
