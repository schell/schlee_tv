Swirling, ethereal layers hover at the fringes of the minimalist foundation of Ashley Allred's voice, guitar and flute on All I Need, her 2014 solo debut. Born out of the final notes of the band she fronted, Odd Bird, All I Need is a note to forward movement while paying tribute to the magic of the recent past. Co-produced, mixed and engineered by Bay Area up-and-comer Paul Haile (Trebuchet, Not To Reason Why) and mastered by Jonathan Burnside (Jawbreaker, Melvins, Sleepy Jackson) the EP steps one foot firmly into the arena as a solo artist to remember.
