It’s October 2021!  Busy month and time to set intentions for all the magic we want to create this Fall & Winter! 

To kick of the month I will be art directing two music videos for other artists.  One video in which I am fully directing, filming, editing and producing and one in which I am writing the screenplay, set designing, co producing and art directing. 

In the middle of the month I will be playing a show accompanied by John Courage at Shady Oak in Santa Rosa, California.  Looking forward to playing some BRAND NEW songs for ya! 

I am also very much looking forward to performing as Blondie for The 6th Annual Halloween Covers Show at the Phoenix Theater on October 29th!  I have been working hard learning this set backwards and forwards to really have it dimed by curtain call! I will have an amazing band backing me up…..Josh Staples from The New Trust on bass guitar and backing vocals, Paul Haile & Navid Manoochehri from Trebuchet on drums and keys, and Alexander Leach from Kingsbough on lead guitar! 

I am excited for what’s to come and look forward to seeing you at these shows! Follow me on Instagram for more! [@schlee_official](https://www.instagram.com/schlee_official/)
