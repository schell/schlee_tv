New Album Tears is almost done! Produced & Recorded  by John Courage at Gremlintone, Partially Recorded, mixed and mastered by Stuart Markham at White Whale.

Tears is compiled of 12 songs which will slowly be released over the next year in 2020 with accompanying music videos for each song.

This album features dreamy textures and a natural compelling dynamic and emotional arc, with also 80â€™s pop influence and dark electro undertones. The vehicles are compelling melodies and lush textures, but the contents are pure feeling and optimism.
